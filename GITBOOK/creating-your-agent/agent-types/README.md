# Agent Types

When you're ready to start creating your AI agent, Fine-Tuner offers two setup options: the "Brand-Centric" setup and the "General-Purpose" setup. The "Brand-Centric" setup allows you to design an AI agent that aligns closely with your company's brand and values, while the "General-Purpose" setup offers a quick and efficient way to create a versatile AI agent. The choice depends on your specific needs and objectives.

This manual is here to guide you through the process, explaining each setup option in detail, discussing their pros and cons, and providing use cases and examples to help you understand when to use which option. By the end of this guide, you should feel confident in choosing the setup that best fits your needs and in creating an AI agent that will bring value to your organization.
