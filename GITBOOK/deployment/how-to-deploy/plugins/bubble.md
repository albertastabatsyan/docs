### Agent | Create

When using the agent creation actions in your workflow you would also need to provide the ID of your Fine-Tuner workspace. The agents will then be created in the respective workspace. This is specifically required for the following actions:

* Agent | Create (Brand-Centric)
* Agent | Create (General-Purpose)

Following demo showcases how you can obtain the ID of your workspace and use in a workflow.
