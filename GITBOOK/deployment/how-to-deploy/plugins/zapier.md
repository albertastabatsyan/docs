# Zapier

[Fine-Tuner's official Zapier plugin](https://zapier.com/apps/fine-tuner/integrations) allows you to connect Fine-Tuner with thousands of the most popular apps.

Zap Templates are pre-configured integrations between the Fine-Tuner app and selected third-party apps on Zapier. They come with pre-selected workflows and core fields, requiring far less time for setting up the integration.

Here are some examples of available Zap Templates:

* **Send Slack channel messages with Fine-Tuner responses for new messages posted to channels in Slack**: This Zap allows your Fine-Tuner agent to respond to new messages in a specified Slack channel.
* **Answer new questions posted in a Discord channel with Fine-Tuner**: This Zap enables your Fine-Tuner agent to respond to new questions posted in a specific Discord channel.
